# CONVERT


A program used to convert the Bible for Windows data base file from the original hash table based format to an alphabetical word order so that a binary search algorithm can be used.

The output comes from BIBLE1F and the result is the database for B4W.
 c.f., repositories for AUSTIN, BIBLE1F, and B4W1P3.
 
P.s.,
Yes, this is all 16 bit code!
